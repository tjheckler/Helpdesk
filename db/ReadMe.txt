Initial login info:

The username: "tjheckler" password: "password" has "Admin" access.
The username: "bbsmith"   password: "password" has "User"  access.

I include this information because it requires you to login to do anything.
Information needs to be populated in the db for most of the  program to work.
The HelpdeskDB.sql includes testing data.

Update email in Email model methods with valid registered email address.
